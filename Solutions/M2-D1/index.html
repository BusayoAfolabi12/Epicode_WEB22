        /* EXERCISE 2
        
        -- You are trying to estimate the total worth of your garage and you're going to create a simple algorithm that calculates it
    
        1) Create a variable to get the number of cars, inside you will save the result of a prompt() function that asks the user how many cars he/she has in the garage
        2) Next, create anotehr variable to ask the user how much a car is worth these days on average, in the same way as before, by using the prompt() function
        3) Do the same for motorbikes and bikes
    
        4) Create 3 variables to hold the value of cars, motorbikes and bikes by multiplying the number of each by the average of each
        5) Create a totalGarageValue variable that sums the three values together
        6) Use an alert() function to display the garage worth in the end with a nice message
